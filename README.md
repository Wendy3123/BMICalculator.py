#LESSON 1 (SOLVE ALL THREE PROBLEMS)

## BMICalculator.py

Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
weight/ height^2

Example Input : (Remember to make final answer and int instead of a float)

weight = 80
height = 1.75
80 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837
26

## LifeInWeeks.py

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

Example Input :
Let users input their age: 56
Then print calculation: You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.

## TipCalculator.py

Calculate the tip given the total bill price. Ask for number of people we are dividing by and how much tip to give.
If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) \* 1.12 = 33.6
Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
